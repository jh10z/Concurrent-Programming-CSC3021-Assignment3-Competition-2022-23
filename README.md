# csc3021 / 2223 assignments

This repository holds code files for the assignments for CSC3021 concurrent programming.

You will clone this repository and move it into your own private repository. You can take following steps:

1. Create a new empty repository on https://gitlab2.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/ in your own name.
   The repository should be entirely empty. Use the "Create blank project" option; do NOT initialize the repository with a README.
   Make sure the repository is private.
2. Add access rights for user h.vandierendonck@qub.ac.uk providing at least developer access
   (guest access does not allow anyone to read your source files)
3. Clone this repository to your computer
   Using a command line, do
   $ git clone https://hpdc-gitlab.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/hvandierendonck/csc3021_assignments_2223.git
4. Point the repository to your own repository
   $ git remote remove origin
   $ git remote add origin https://gitlab2.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/USER/REPO
   where you replace USER and REPO by the appropriate names
5. Push the repository to the server
   $ git push origin master

You should now be able to see on the https://gitlab2.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/ website that your repository REPO has content.
This README file should be visible.
